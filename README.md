# Guitar-synthesis

This matlab function synthesises 6-string acoustic guitar. It takes as input arguments the frequency (Hz) user wants to be played by each string. Guitar's body is simulated by bandpass fillters and transverse string waves with delay lines. All of these six different sounds are then added and played back.
